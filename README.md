Pipe leak detector is a proof of concept that you can use computer vision and a simple mathematical model to detect water leaks in static enviroments. Using a raspberry pi powered picarX with a camera. 

The algorithm is inspired by the formula of standard diviation. 
It works by rappidly taking pictures and converting them to grayscale images and then calculating the average pixelvalue of those images before calculating the difference between the average pixel values and the pictures pixel values of all the images.

This makes the droplets in the pictures stand out from the rest of the image. Which is then used to detect that there is a waterleak in the picture.

We then detect where there is a white mark on the image and then add a green rectange around the detected droplet.
